# Processing-Arduino_Keypad
#Standard Assignment (all must complete)

Create a Processing program that when hooked up to the Arduino via USB plays specific sounds in response to specific key presses. It should play a different sound for all 12 keys and support simultaneous sounds (pressing the same key repeatedly) and multiple key presses (pressing multiple keys at once). 

#Hacker Assignment (optional, provides no additional credit)

Pick some of the features below and implement them.

Recording: Keypad has a key that when pressed records all keypresses until the key is pressed again. Then either: playback of the pressed keys should continuously loop or should be available by pressing a second activation key.
Background: Keypad has one or more keys that toggle on background audio that samples can be played over. These tracks should loop forever and should mix nicely together when switched.
More Keys: Keypad has a key that when held or pressed changes the functionality of all the other keys.
Filters: Keypad has one or more keys that toggle on after effects like reverb or noise.
